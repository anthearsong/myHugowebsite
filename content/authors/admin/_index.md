Anthear is lover of plants and poetry though she now works on her PhD in Linguistics. Her research areas include Psycholinguistics, Cognitive Linguistics, and Cognitive Poetics. She is interested in exploring the cognitive mechanisms underlying people’s use and understanding of figurative languages like metaphor and metonymy in both literary and non-literary contexts. By the way, she has two cats, one named Alice and one named Bob, please guess their gender...
